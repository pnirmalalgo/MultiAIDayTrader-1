    Write Python code to implement the following stock trading strategy.
    Ensure the output is only executable Python code ‚Äî no comments, markdown, pip install statements, or ```python wrappers.

    General Instructions:
    1. Use only `pandas` and the `ta` library (assume pre-installed).
    2. DO NOT fetch data from yfinance or any other API.
    3. Use `sqlite3` and `pandas.read_sql` to load data from `market_data.db`, table: `stock_data`.
    - Columns: 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Volume', 'Ticker', 'Date'
    - Order data in ascending order of `Date`.

    Strategy Requirements:
    4. Strategy type, buy/sell logic, and indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD, MA) are given below:
    Strategy: {strategy}
    Buy Condition: {buy_condition}
    Sell Condition: {sell_condition}    
    5. Compute only the indicators mentioned in the strategy.
    6. For `turning` with `value: positive`: detect sign change from negative to positive.
    Example: (macd[i-1] < 0) & (macd[i] > 0)

    Signal Logic:
    7. Combine multiple conditions using the logic key (`and`/`or`) in a vectorized way using `&` / `|` with parentheses.
    - DO NOT use Python's plain `and` / `or` on pandas Series.
    8. For duration_type = "consecutive", use rolling windows to check if condition is met for duration_days.
    Example: RSI < 30 for 2 consecutive days ‚Üí use `.rolling(window=2).apply(...)`

    Buy/Sell Execution Rules:
    9. Use a flag `position_open` to track whether a position is currently open.
    - Start with position_open = False
    - Set to True on a buy; set to False on a sell
    10. Sell signals should only be generated if a position is open.
    11. Ignore sells before the first buy.
    12. Do not allow consecutive buys or sells ‚Äî signals must strictly alternate: buy ‚Üí sell ‚Üí buy.
    
    Buy/Sell Signal Alignment:

    - Do not forward-fill Buy/Sell columns.
    - DO NOT reassign index using data.index[buy_prices.index] ‚Äî THIS CAUSES INDEXERROR.
    - Avoid manually resetting or reassigning indices on filtered signal series; trust their inherited indices from the source data to maintain correct time alignment.
    - After generating buy_signals and sell_signals, create the trades DataFrame, then drop rows where both Buy and Sell are NaN:
        trades.dropna(how='all', inplace=True)
    - Extract buy_prices and sell_prices using .dropna():
        buy_prices = trades['Buy'].dropna()
        sell_prices = trades['Sell'].dropna()
    - If the number of buy/sell signals is unequal, truncate the longer one:
        min_len = min(len(buy_prices), len(sell_prices))
        buy_prices = buy_prices.iloc[:min_len]
        sell_prices = sell_prices.iloc[:min_len]
    - This ensures signals alternate and are aligned for return calculations and plotting.
    - Always define buy_prices and sell_prices as empty pd.Series(dtype=float) before the if trades.empty: block, to avoid NameError when trades are empty.
    - This will prevent the IndexError, keep buy/sell signals aligned, and make your code more robust and clear.

    ROLLING INDICATOR:
        For any rolling indicator (e.g., 50-day high, average volume, moving average, etc.), always apply a .shift(1) to the rolling series before comparison. This ensures the current value is compared against the most recent past indicator value ‚Äî avoiding self-referential logic which prevents valid breakouts or threshold crossings from being detected.
    
    IMPORTANT: Ensure that moving average crossover strategies (like golden cross or death cross) are not mistakenly implemented using MACD crossovers. A death cross should specifically refer to shorter MA < longer MA (e.g., 50MA < 200MA), and not MACD < signal line.
    Always maintain and update a variable for the current position‚Äôs entry price when trades are opened, especially if future logic depends on it (like stop-loss or target exits).
    
    Returns & Metrics:
    14. Use completed trades only to compute: - Store results in a comparison table (trading_results.html). Print the name of the file.
        - Cumulative returns
        - Annualized return
        - Volatility
        - Maximum drawdown
    IMPORTANT: Before using variables like annualized_return, volatility, etc., ensure they are always defined ‚Äî even if trades are not executed. Initialize them to None before the conditional block.
    15. Annualized return:
            Use number of calendar days between first buy and last sell.
            IMPORTANT: When calculating annualized_return:

            First, reassign datetime indexes to buy_prices and sell_prices:

            buy_prices.index = data.index[buy_prices.index]
            sell_prices.index = data.index[sell_prices.index]


            Then extract the first and last trade dates directly from the reassigned indexes:

            buy_date = pd.to_datetime(buy_prices.index[0])
            sell_date = pd.to_datetime(sell_prices.index[-1])


            ‚úÖ Do NOT index into data.index[...] again after reassignment. The buy_prices.index[...] is already datetime-like, and trying to do data.index[...] on it will fail.
            Use this value to calculate annualized return:
            annualized_return = cumulative_returns.iloc[-1] ** (365 / days_held) - 1 if days_held > 0 else 0

            Other rules:
            If days_held == 0, return 0 for annualized return.
            When calculating number of days between two dates ((sell_date - buy_date).days), always make sure both are datetime objects.
            If dates are stored in columns or come from indexes, always cast them using pd.to_datetime(...) before subtraction.
            Do not assume .index is datetime unless you've explicitly set it with df.index = pd.to_datetime(df.index).
    16. Volatility = standard deviation of trade returns √ó sqrt(252)
    17. Handle empty trades gracefully: if no trades, return 0 or None for all metrics and print a log message.
    IMPORTANT: - When implementing crossover-based trading signals (e.g., SMA crossovers), detect the *actual crossover event* by comparing the current and previous values of the moving averages:
    - A **buy signal** should be generated only when the short-term MA crosses *from below to above* the long-term MA (i.e., previous short-term MA ‚â§ previous long-term MA AND current short-term MA > current long-term MA).
    - A **sell signal** should be generated only when the short-term MA crosses *from above to below* the long-term MA (i.e., previous short-term MA ‚â• previous long-term MA AND current short-term MA < current long-term MA).
    - Avoid generating buy/sell signals repeatedly if the condition is just sustained (e.g., short-term MA > long-term MA) without an actual crossover event.
    
    Plotting: IMPORTANT: Do not run plotting logic if there is no data.
    18. Use `plotly.graph_objects`:
        - Plot 'Close' price as blue line
        - Plot Buy markers (green triangle-up), Sell markers (red triangle-down)
        - No y-offset for markers ‚Äî use actual Close values
        - Save as {ticker}_plot.html. Print the name of file.
    Ensure plotting code that uses buy_prices or sell_prices does not crash when these are empty. Use conditional checks like: if not buy_prices.empty: and if not sell_prices.empty:
    Ensure that buy_prices and sell_prices have a proper DatetimeIndex before plotting.
        When you extract them using .dropna(), the index may be a default integer index.
        You must reassign the correct datetime index using the original data DataFrame like this:

        buy_prices = trades['Buy'].dropna()
        buy_prices.index = data.index[buy_prices.index]

        sell_prices = trades['Sell'].dropna()
        sell_prices.index = data.index[sell_prices.index]

        This guarantees that Plotly plots markers at the correct positions on the time axis.
        If you skip this, the buy/sell markers may incorrectly appear around 1970 or outside the actual data range.
        IMPORTANT: Once you've reassigned buy_prices.index and sell_prices.index using data.index[...], access the first/last dates directly via .index[0] and .index[-1]. Do not attempt to index back into data.index[...] using those values ‚Äî it will cause an error.
    
        IMPORTANT: After generating the buy and sell signals as arrays (e.g., buy_signals and sell_signals), attach them as columns to the main ticker_data DataFrame before attempting to access or visualize them.

            ‚úÖ Example:

        ticker_data['Buy'] = buy_signals  
        ticker_data['Sell'] = sell_signals  


        This ensures the 'Buy' and 'Sell' columns are available in ticker_data when printing or plotting.

        üîÅ Also, if you're using a separate trades DataFrame to store signals, ensure you use it consistently or integrate the signals back into the main DataFrame before referencing them.

        Avoid using variables like buy_signals, sell_signals, or trades across different tickers without recalculating them.
            Either:
            Move plotting inside the main loop per ticker, or
            Store buy/sell data separately for each ticker to avoid index mismatches.    
    
    19. Print the rows where buy/sell signals occur ‚Äî include Date, Close, and indicators.
        - Do not print trades.dropna() or trades[['Buy', 'Sell']].dropna() at the end of the script, as it may misleadingly appear empty. Instead, print the full trades DataFrame or use a filtered version only if it has meaningful rows (e.g., only drop rows where both Buy and Sell are NaN using dropna(how='all')).
        
                
    Moving Averages:
    20. Only compute and plot MA if explicitly mentioned in the strategy.
        - Plot as dotted line
        - Use different colors for different MA periods

    Multi-Ticker Logic:
    21. If multiple tickers are present:
        - Generate plots and metrics for each ticker separately.
        - Filter the data by ticker to generate plot and metrics for each ticker.
        - There should be one plot html file for each ticker.
        - And trading_results.html should contain the table containing metrics from each ticker. i.e. one row per ticker.
        

    Edge Cases & Debugging:
    22. Print SQL query result for debugging.
    23. Avoid ambiguous pandas boolean errors ‚Äî always use parentheses in conditions
    24. Do not use `.between()` in loops; use it only with full pandas Series
    25. VERY IMPORTANT: For cumulative calculations like cumulative returns, max drawdown, and cumulative sums:
        Always keep the data as pandas Series, never convert to NumPy arrays before these operations.
        Use pandas Series methods .cumprod(), .cummax(), .cumsum().
        Access elements with .iloc[] or .loc[] only on pandas Series or DataFrames, never on NumPy arrays.
        When calculating returns for vectorized operations, you may convert to NumPy arrays temporarily only for element-wise arithmetic, but do not convert the resulting Series for cumulative or indexed operations.
        To avoid errors, do vectorized math like (sell_prices - buy_prices) / buy_prices on NumPy arrays but then wrap the result back into a pandas Series before .cumprod() or .iloc usage. For example:
            returns = pd.Series((sell_prices - buy_prices) / buy_prices)  
            cumulative_returns = (1 + returns).cumprod()  
            annualized_return = cumulative_returns.iloc[-1] ** (365 / days_held) - 1  
        Never call .iloc on a NumPy array.
    26. If no trades are executed:
        - Print message: "No trades executed for {ticker}"
        - Return 0 or None for all calculated metrics
    27. When setting a column (e.g., Date) as index in a DataFrame, ensure subsequent code accessing that column uses .index instead of referring to it as a column.
        - For example, replace df['Date'] with df.index if Date is the index.
        - Maintain consistency between column and index usage to avoid KeyError.
        - Alternatively, avoid setting important columns as index if they need to be accessed as columns later.

    Final Output:
    28. For each ticker:
        - Save interactive plot as HTML file
        - Print DataFrame rows for buy/sell points
        - Include a summary HTML comparing metrics across tickers
